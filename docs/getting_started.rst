Getting Started

A quick guide to getting started with Factorio RCON GUI

Downloading and running
-----------------------

    Go to the `releases <https://github.com/ComputerComa/Facotorio-rcon-gui/releases>`_  page and Download the latest release.
    Once it has downloaded double click to run the file.
    You might get a warning about running an unknown executable that looks like this:

    Click on more info and Click Run Anyway. I haven't gotten around to signing the executable yet.
